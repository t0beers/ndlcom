encoding
--------

- create crc with 0x1021 polynomial

- unescaped payload is used for crc-calculation
- initialize new crcs with 0xffff as start-value
- start/stop flag and escape-flags are never seen by crc function

- no final xor of the crc-value
- the crc-value itself is escaped if needed and then appended after the last
  escaped payload-byte, before the packet-end-flag

decoding
--------

- new crc is again initialized with 0xffff
- after de-escaping the received bytes, header+payload is stuffed into crc-function
- the crc-value itself is also passed into the function
- if after the header+payload+crc was fed into the crc-function, the result is "zero" on success
