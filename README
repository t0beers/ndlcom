ndlcom_core
-----------

functions to encode/decode simple serial communication OSI-layer2 message format

called "ndlcom" for "Node Data Link Communication"

STRUCTURE
-- src/ 
	Contains all source files (*.c)
-- include/ndlcom_core/ 
	Contains all header files (*.h)
-- xml

    Contains a set of xml file, transformations and schemas to generate a set of
    deviceId<->deviceName mappings. This is compiled into the c-library for easy,
    unified and quick access on all supported plattforms. Tools for some other
    languages are additionally generated.
    
    For this to work, cmake has to be given the xml-file to use. Either on the
    cmake-commandline:
    $ rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake -Dndlcom_core_DEVICE_IDS=sherpa .. && cd .. && make -C build
    or in the top-level CMakeLists of your project:
    echo "set(${PROJECT_NAME}_DEVICE_IDS DeviceIds)" >> $TOP_LEVEL/CMakeLists.txt

-- build/
	The target directory for the build process, temporary content
